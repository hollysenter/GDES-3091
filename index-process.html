                <h2>Intention</h2>
                <p>
                    I like creating web pages that are both functional and artistic. I don’t like web pages that are
                    extremely artistically abstract because I find them useless and boring, but I also know that code
                    without art is the most boring. When considering what I wanted my Index to look like, I decided that
                    a page with obvious function married with a fun design would best represent my type of web creating.
                    This is what I hope I have accomplished with my Index. To reach this point, I started by thinking
                    about what my interest and hobbies are, and how I could organically incorporate them into the
                    website. The favicon assignment helped me do this.

                <h2>Favicon</h2>
                <p>
                    My original favicon was a camera icon created using the shape of my initials. I chose to do this
                    because I have a passion for photography, videography, and entertainment media, so I felt it best
                    represented my interests. I love the design and will continue to use it for self-representation.
                    However, though it is clever in full view, when used as a small icon it’s unclear what it’s meant to
                    be. I decided to redesign while still incorporating my interests. This led me to Netflix. I have a
                    deep love of reading, fantasy, movies, and TV series. Creating a Netflix-like site seemed like a fun
                    and functional way to display my work.

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    I started by looking at the Netflix home screen and seeing what aspects I should copy, and which
                    would be outside of my ability to code. I liked the idea of having a carousel of “movies” which
                    would represent all my works. And though Netflix films don’t move of their own accord, I thought it
                    would be a good way to incorporate animation if I had the movies moving across the page. This also
                    requires the user to be more engaged to navigate the page.

                <h2>Design Choices</h2>
                <p>
                    After I had coded the layout of the page, I started creating the visual elements in Photoshop. I
                    wanted to have the icon Netflix logo for my Title (Index) and for each piece of work from the
                    semester to have its own movie cover. I used a different font for every movie and images from the
                    work itself to make the design.

                <p>
                    I realized that while the moving images was fun, it wasn’t realistic for someone to view my work
                    that way because they would have to wait for it to return to the screen. I coded separate pages
                    which had lists of the works to make it easy to access. I designed these pages to look like
                    episodes.

                <p>
                    I am very happy with the look of my Index. I feel that it accurately represents my interests as well
                    as my coding style. If I had more time, I would incorporate more functions that are like how a
                    Netflix page functions. For example, when you enter Netflix it first asks who is watching and makes
                    you pick an icon – I would like to add that for the user to be more interactive.
