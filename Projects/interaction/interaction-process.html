                <p>
                    With previous assignments, I was able to start experimenting with code without much pre-planning.
                    For this assignment, planning and research were the most important parts of the process. Before I
                    got anywhere near coding, I
                    looked for examples of how the keyboard could be used in an interactive way. I also researched what
                    keyboard functions are possible in JavaScript. I created an Are.na channel of different sites to
                    help me organize my ideas and see what was possible.

                <p>
                    A challenge I had was deciding which way to take the project, as itâ€™s a rather open-ended assignment
                    with lots of room for experimentation.
                    To help bring my thoughts into actual plans and decide the best course of action, I created a
                    brainstorming document. This list of ideas was purely based on concept, not code. I took the three
                    that I thought were most realistic with my coding abilities and then started experimenting with
                    coding.

                <h2>Iterations</h2>
                <p>
                    When brainstorming the most notable ways a keystroke could impact a webpage would, image and colour
                    change came to mind. The first idea I experimented with used images of things that
                    start with the same letter as the pressed key. The next idea was a
                    more functional webpage, which displayed different pages based on keys pressed. When you typed a
                    letter, it would take you to that letter's page where you would either guess
                    the correct of the displayed letter, or change colour based on what was typed. The third idea was a
                    simple word guessing game where you have 10 chances to choose letters and get the correct answer.

                <p>
                    I liked all these ideas, but the first idea was the most visually and conceptually appealing to me
                    and the more abstract of the three (as per the assignment requirements). The guessing game was fun
                    and interactive, but not original. The colour idea was original, but more functional than abstract
                    or entertaining. The keyboard creating a visual response seemed the most appropriate. However, the
                    randomness of the images made it a difficult to understand user experience. To fix this, I had the
                    idea to create an architectural alphabet. My mother was a photographer and for a long time she made
                    prints featuring letters she found in architecture. I created a Pinterest board with her photos to
                    use as source material for the alphabet.

                <h2>Refinement</h2>
                <p>
                    This refinement made it much clearer what the images represented while still being an artistic and
                    original expression of type. I realized it would be even more
                    interesting if there were a pool of potential images for each letter so that each time was clicked
                    there would be a different representational image. This required me to change my
                    JavaScript code and experiment with randomization. I also had to create code for the backspace key
                    and the enter key so that a user could experience typing like they would on a word document. After
                    this, a lot of the changes were based on design rather than function. For example, my first code
                    used blocks to display the title page, but I decided to replace that with an image I created which
                    was cleaner and easier to scale down.

                <p>
                    This resulted in my final webpage design. After a lot of adjustments, I ended with a functional and
                    abstract alphabet that creates a visually intriguing keyboard experience. The page can be used for a
                    variety of purposes. This project taught me a lot about JavaScript. Though it is not my preferred
                    way
                    to code, I am glad to have a better understanding of it.
