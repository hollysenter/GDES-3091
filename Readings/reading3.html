        <h2>#1 How does Drucker define the term "interface"? How about the process of designing interfaces? What is
            her opinion of interface design processes as they are generally handled today?</h2>
        <p>
            Drucker describes the term “interface” as “a mediating structure that supports behaviours and tasks"
            (Drucker 138). She explains that the commonly accepted understanding of interface is a fixed,
            representational portal into the online world, but the flaw in this thinking is that it ignores the
            complicated construction behind the portal. The interface not only shows us the online world, but it also
            acts as a mediator for us into it. Drucker believes that the proper process of designing an interface
            involves both the means to access information, but also the information itself. While the function of the
            interface is important, it is not the essence of the interface. It must take into consideration cultural
            differences and be flexible enough to create individual, human experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drucker has a disliking of how interfaces are designed today. Professional interface designers typically
            create a mechanic design that translates the users’ needs into a function, creating a clear but static
            interface. This is done because it is the best software practice, but not because it is the best interface
            practice. It focuses on the “user” as a general persona vs a “humanistic subject” which acknowledges that
            every user will be different, and no one interface will accommodate all. Drucker wants to see the humanistic
            subject become the focus for interface design, which would allow more diverse design.
        </p>

        <h2>#2 What is Drucker's notion of "Humanistic Design"?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The humanistic design is how Drucker would approach fixing her issues with current interface design. Her
            idea of a humanistic design is one that acknowledges that there will never be one user experience that
            accommodates all people. Instead of ignoring that, designers would lean into it. Subjectivity is not
            typically used as the ideology for designing an interface that is easy to understand because it creates too
            much variability. User-oriented designs seeks to make the interface as obvious as possible. Drucker argues
            that subjectivity is necessary for a better design. Instead of focusing on the “user”, humanistic design
            focuses on the “subject”. A subject-oriented interface recognizes that the subject’s point of view will
            impact the experience, no matter how hard a designer tries to streamline it. If designing with this
            knowledge in mind, the interface can accommodate more autonomy (preferences, customs, whims etc.). As she
            describes,
        </p>
        <p>
            “We need to theorize interface and its relation to reading as an environment in which varied behaviors of
            embodied and situated persons will be enabled differently according to its many affordances. This shifts us
            away from the HCI world, and the interface, into fields closer to graphic design and media theory, an
            important move in reading and designing interface (Drucker 146).”

        <h2>#3 As a process, what factors do you feel are central to the design of interfaces that are missing from
            this article?
        </h2>
        <p>
            While Drucker’s article was very successful at describing the theories and ideas behind interface design, it
            was perhaps too theoretical and lacked some practical applications. One important aspect of interface design
            that I found lacking from Drucker’s narrative was user research. Understanding the behaviours and
            expectations of the user allows the designer to create an interface that is intuitive and actually needed.
            It is only by conducting primary and secondary research and analyzing that data that a designer can gain
            insights into the necessary design elements. Another aspect of the interface design process not fully
            developed here is accessibility and usability. I would argue that (especially with a humanistic design in
            mind) these two things are crucial. Interfaces should be easy to navigate and clear. If not, a user is far
            more likely to abandon the site. Interfaces should also be usable by the most amount of people possible, for
            example, those with disabilities like impaired vision or hearing. Creating designs with accessibility in
            mind will result in greater usability for all users. While Drucker brushed upon these ideas generally, the
            article might have benefited from stepping away from conceptual jargon and outlining the actual steps
            required for designing an interface.
