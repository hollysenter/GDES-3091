        <h2>#1 Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her?
            Please explain your answer.</h2>
        <p>
            Laurel points out that while social media platforms initially appear accommodating, they are in fact
            manipulative. Behind each site is a company which is prioritizing advertising and sales over the user’s
            needs. Naturally, most users feel anxiety in relation to social media rather than fulfillment. A personal
            website fulfills the same inherit desire that social media should: an opportunity to express oneself.
            However, a website can be personalized in a way that these company-owned sites cannot. Laurel argues that
            for the web to be authentic, it needs to be run by individuals rather than corporations. It needs to
            actually fulfill the users needs rather than the needs of a company. She believes that individual websites
            can bring the web back to its original architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand what Laurel is arguing and do believe that she is correct in theory. I don’t see her solution
            as realistic – at least not today. While the idea of untouched, unlimited possibilities for personal
            expression is intriguing, it’s difficult to put in practice. Most people have no idea how to create a
            website, let alone what they would put on that website if they did. Social media platforms give people who
            do not know – or do not want to know - how to use the web an opportunity to still be present online.

        <h2>#2 In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a
            paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website.

                A website is a digital billboard on the vast highway of the internet, showcasing its message to passing
                online traffic. The homepage is the towering signboard, immediately capturing attention with its bold
                visuals and concise information, conveying a message in a glance. Just as a well-designed billboard
                strategically displays key information, a website's layout and design can swiftly convey the essence of
                its
                content. The navigation bar is the call to action, guiding visitors to different sections. The
                effectiveness
                of a website, much like a billboard, lies in its ability to make an impression and communicate its core
                message succinctly amidst the fast-paced flow of digital users traversing the online highway.
